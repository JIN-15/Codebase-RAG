## Introduction  

This project demonstrates how to create an AI agent capable of answering questions about a codebase, providing detailed insights, and identifying areas for improvement. The solution embeds code into a vector database (Pinecone) and retrieves relevant parts to generate responses using OpenAI’s Language Models.  

---

## Features  

- **Codebase Embedding:** Converts code files into vector embeddings for efficient querying.  
- **Real-time Code Analysis:** Queries and retrieves specific parts of a codebase to answer questions.  
- **Slack Integration:** Use the `/ai-coding-agent-help` command to interact with the AI agent in Slack.  
- **Highly Scalable:** Handles large codebases with Pinecone’s vector database.

## Architecture  

1. **Codebase Embedding:**  
   - Convert code snippets into vector representations using an embedding model (e.g., OpenAI).  
2. **Vector Database (Pinecone):**  
   - Store and query code embeddings efficiently.  
3. **Language Models (LLMs):**  
   - Generate detailed and context-aware answers based on retrieved code.  
4. **Slack Integration:**  
   - Provide real-time support for queries directly from Slack.  

---

## Prerequisites  

- Python 3.7+  
- Pinecone API Key  
- OpenAI API Key  
- Slack Workspace with API Integration Enabled

## Setup and Installation  

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git  
   cd your-repo-name  
   ```  

2. **Install Required Libraries**:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

3. **Setup Pinecone**:  
   - Create an account on [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/).  
   - Create an index with dimensions matching the embedding model (e.g., 768).  

4. **Setup OpenAI API Key**:  
   - Sign up at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/).  
   - Obtain your API key and add it to the environment variables.  

5. **Configure Slack Integration**:  
   - Create a Slack bot and integrate it with your workspace.  
   - Enable the `/ai-coding-agent-help` command.  

6. **Run the Application**:  
   ```bash  
   python main.py  
   ```

## Usage  

1. **Embedding the Codebase**:  
   - Run the script to embed your codebase into the Pinecone vector database.  

2. **Querying the Codebase**:  
   - Use Slack to send queries with the `/ai-coding-agent-help` command.  

3. **Understanding the Outputs**:  
   - The AI will retrieve the most relevant code snippets and generate a detailed response.  

---

## How It Works  

1. **Embed Codebase**:  
   - The tool reads through your codebase and converts code files into vector embeddings.  

2. **Store in Pinecone**:  
   - These embeddings are stored in Pinecone, enabling efficient similarity-based searches.  

3. **Process Queries**:  
   - User queries are passed through the LLMs, which retrieve relevant embeddings from Pinecone to generate a response.  

4. **Respond in Slack**:  
   - The generated response is sent back to the user via Slack.  

---

## Technologies Used  

- **Python**: Core programming language for building the tool.  
- **Pinecone**: Vector database for embedding storage and retrieval.  
- **OpenAI LLMs**: For generating natural language responses.  
- **Slack API**: For integration with Slack commands.  

---

## Future Enhancements  

- Add support for multi-language codebases.  
- Implement fine-tuned models for better code understanding.  
- Enhance Slack integration with more commands and features.
